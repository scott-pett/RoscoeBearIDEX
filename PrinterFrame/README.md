# The printer frame

Like the Bear modifications for the Prusa MK3, the frame utilizes fairly typical 2040 aluminium extrusions with either 3D printed or metal brackets and braces. However, the lengths of most of the components are increased to allow for the greater width necessary to park the extruders away from the print bed. This allows each of the extruders to use the full bed area to print. The height is also increased.

When ordering the metalwork it is probably best to obtain the parts pre-cut to length as they need to be cut accurately. My frame components were supplied by Ooznest in the UK. [Ooznest](https://ooznest.co.uk) I have no links with them other thna a satisfied customer.

Here's a specification for the extrusions:

X extrusion   570mm long - 2 required
Y extrusion   331mm long - 2 required
Z extrusion   415mm long - 2 required
Top extrusion 490mm long - 1 required

I have found that even at this width, the extruders can get very close to one another and adding 5mm to the X and Top extrusions may make things a little easier space wise.

In addition you will need 10 off 90ยบ Corner Joining Plates. Mine were 3D printed in PETG and have so far proved strong and resilient enough. Print files are in the STL folder. Although they may be OBJ files which are slightly less prone to corruption and requiring repair in your slicer.

So at this point its worth pointing out that in the grand 3D printing tradition, you will need access to a 3D printer to create the new 3D printer. Failing that, a 3D print serivce may be availed upon if necessary.
