# The printer frame

Like the Bear modifications for the Prusa MK3, the frame utilizes fairly typical 2040 aluminium extrusions with either 3D printed or metal brackets and braces. However, the lengths of most of the components are increased to allow for the greater width necessary to park the extruders away from the print bed. This allows each of the extruders to use the full bed area to print. The height is also increased.

When ordering the metalwork it is probably best to obtain the parts pre-cut to length as they need to be cut accurately. My frame components were supplied by [Ooznest](https://ooznest.co.uk) in the UK. I have no links with them other thna a satisfied customer. You will, of course, use your preferred supplier.

Here's a specification for the extrusions:

X extrusion   570mm long - 2 required
Y extrusion   331mm long - 2 required
Z extrusion   415mm long - 2 required
Top extrusion 490mm long - 1 required

I have found that even at this width, the extruders can get very close to one another and adding 5mm to the X and Top extrusions may make things a little easier space wise.

# Printed Parts

In addition you will need 10 off 90ยบ Corner Joining Plates. Mine were 3D printed in PETG and have so far proved strong and resilient enough. P

For most of the time, the printed part files can be obtained from @gregsaun's github repository here:  https://github.com/gregsaun/prusa_i3_bear_upgrade

Where I have developed different components, or where I use a different print file, they will be found in the STL folder - although they may be OBJ, 3MF or STEP format which are somewhat more robust. If you find issues with any files, please let me know,

So at this point its worth pointing out the flipping obvious, that in the grand 3D printing tradition, you will need access to a 3D printer to create the new 3D printer. Failing that a 3D print serivce may be availed upon to do the necessary.

# Fixings
Fixings for the frame are M5 button head screws in various lengths along with M5 Tee nuts. the Bear Bill of Materials (BOM) should be pretty accurate for our needs, but its worth purchasing extras screws. If oyu only have enough, then one will invariably disappear behind a box in your workshop. If you purchase spares, then "The Law" says you will not need them.
