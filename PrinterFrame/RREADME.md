# The printer frame

Like the Bear modifications for the Prusa MK3, the frame used fairly typical 4020 aluminium extrusions with either 3D printed or metal brackets and braces. However, the lengths of most of the components are increased to allow for the greater width necessary to park the extruders away from the print bed. This allows each of the extruders to use the full bed area to print.

When ordering the metalwork it is probably best to obtain the parts pre-cut and they need to be cut accurately. My frame components were supplied by Ooznest in the UK. [Ooznest](https://ooznest.co.uk)
